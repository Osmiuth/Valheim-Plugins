# Sailing

Adds a skill that increases the health of ships built by you, the sailing speed of ships commanded by you and your exploration radius while on a ship.

Ship speed can be configured per ship and supports ships added by other mods as well.

Also has the option to lock ship speeds to specific skill levels.

Adds a ship nudge hotkey (Default: Left Shift) you can hold down while interacting with the ladder of a ship, to give it a small push.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
